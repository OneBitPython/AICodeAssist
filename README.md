# AICodeAssist

This was the second project that I had made back in Jan, 2021 for an Intel AI bootcamp. It's a pretty impressive project in my opinion. It has the features of a basic AI.
Some of its features are - 
    i) Sending whatsapp messages, better be signed in to whatsapp web
    ii) Opening youtube
    iii) Opening google
    iv) Search things on google
    v) Play a youtube video
    vi) Search things on wiki
    vii) Basic conversations
    viii) Answering mathmatical problems
    ix) Telling jokes
    x) BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY help in your coding doubts
    
It uses cosine similarity but is not synced up with a GUI (run in terminal). It also provides resources for the questions that you ask like
what is pandas, what is the requests module in python, what is cosine similairy, explain variables in programming, etc.

To setup the project, download and extract the repo then run 
pip install -r requirements.txt
this installs the required modules

finally run
python MAIN.py

make sure that you are in the same directory when running these commands in the same directory
